# About the Study

The CHAT is a multi-center, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial designed to test whether after a 7-month observation period, children, ages 5 to 9.9 years,  with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea randomized to early adenotonsillectomy eAT) will show greater levels of neurocognitive functioning, specifically in the attention-executive functioning domain, than children randomized to watchful waiting plus supportive care (WWSC). Other outcomes assessed included other indices of neurocognitive functioning (learning and memory, information processing, etc.), physical growth, blood pressure, metabolic profile, symptoms and quality of life. Physiological measures of sleep were assessed at baseline and at 7-months with standardized full polysomnography with central scoring at the Brigham and Womenâ€™s Sleep Reading Center. In total, 1,447 children had screening polysomnographs and 464 were randomized to treatment.
