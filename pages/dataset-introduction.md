# Dataset Introduction

The [CHAT dataset](:files_path:/datasets) posted on the NSRR has gone through various post-processing steps in order to prepare the data for more widespread sharing.

## Structure of the Dataset

The dataset is broken down into `baseline` and `followup` files, each of which contain 464 rows. Participants who withdrew or did not complete the protocol will have a greater prevalence of missing data in the `followup` file.
