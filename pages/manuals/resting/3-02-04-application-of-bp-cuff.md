## 3.2.4 Application of the Blood Pressure Cuff

Next, the appropriate cuff (as determined in the arm measurement procedure) is placed
around the bare upper left arm so that the midpoint of the length of the bladder lies over
the brachial artery and the mid-height of the cuff is at heart level. The lower edge of the
cuff, with its tubing connections, should be placed about 1 inch above the natural crease
across the inner aspect of the elbow. The cuff is wrapped snuggly about the arm, still
with the palm of the participantâ€™s hand turned upward. The wrapped cuff should be
secured firmly by applying pressure to the locking fabric fastener over the area where it
is applied to the cuff.
