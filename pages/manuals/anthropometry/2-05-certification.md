## 2.5 Certification

### _Certification for anthropometry requires_

1. Participation in central training and observation of performing these
measurements on 3 volunteers by the CHAT trainer
2. Evidence by direct observation at central training that all elements of
measurement are followed (placement of tapes, preparation of the
participant);
3. Evidence of agreement of 3 replicate readings within 0.5 cms
4. Evidence of agreement with the standard to within 0.5 cms, using the
average of 3 readings per practice study subject.

_Note:_ Research staff who did not participate in central training may be trained
and certified by the CHAT-certified coordinator.\

### _To assure accuracy and ongoing training:_
1. Every month, each anthropometrist will be observed measuring one
subject by the site Study Coordinator, who will review and document
adherence to protocol.
2. At least once every 3 months, two certified anthropometrists at each site
will obtain the same measurements on the same participant, and blindly
record each.

These data will be communicated to the DCC which will identify if systematic differences
and quantify level of agreement.
