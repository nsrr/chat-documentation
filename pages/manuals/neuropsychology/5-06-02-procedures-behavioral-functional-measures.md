## 5.6.2 Procedures for Behavioral and Functional Measures Administered by NP Staff

Parents will be asked to complete several short questionnaires in a separate room while
their children are being tested.

  * The Conners’ Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Long Version (CPRS-R:L), the
Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF), the Achenbach
Child Behavior Checklist (ages 6-18) will be given to parents to complete during
the first part of the child testing session by the site NP psychometrist who will
also check to ensure completion of each form to avoid missing items.
  * At most centers The Epworth, Sleep and Health, Peds QL, and OSA-18 forms
will be given out to the parents at the testing break. Individual centers may vary
as to who hands out the forms and when, though each center will establish a
protocol to ensure that all forms are completed for each visit and all forms are
checked to ensure no missing items.
  * None of these forms will be sent home
  * All efforts possible and reasonable will be made by the Coordinator to ensure
that the same parent informant is available for the Baseline, 7-month, and 12-
month visits. The parent filling out the form is listed in the Administrative Form
(NPLOG). It may be easiest to leave two spaces blank below the child’s name in
the NPLOG when he/she is first entered into the study to easily ensure
consistency in Test Version and Informant across visits for each particular child.
  * If the Informant is not the same as Baseline, this will trigger the examiner to
check the “Questionable” box for those specific Informant measures on the
Neuropsychological Test Validity Form (NPVAL).
  * The Validity responses on the NPVAL are based on subjective ratings by
the examiner and neuropsychologist. Other validity checks (e.g.,
Inconsistency Score from the BRIEF) can also be consulted.
  * There may be some site-to-site variability due to time constraints and other
issues that will require close coordination between the psychometrists and
coordinators regarding these parent measures, in particular the sleep measures
given the time it takes for parents to complete them. For example, in some sites,
coordinators may handle most of the sleep forms, though in others, it may be
more efficient to have parents fill out the forms while waiting for their child’s
neuropsychological testing to be completed, as suggested above.
  * At the end of the session, the psychometrists checks for any additional missing
responses on all the forms and then asks the parents to wait until the CDI is
scored
