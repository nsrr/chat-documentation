* The psychometrist will review the child’s response to the CDI prior to the child’s
discharge from the research center.
* The CDI score is written on the Administrative Form (NPAB), regardless of the
score.
* Children who endorsed a suicidal intent on the CDI (i.e., answer positive to the third
option in Item 9 for imminent risk of suicide, ”I want to kill myself.”) OR with a total CDI T
Score > 70, will be identified to the site study licensed psychologist, who will contact the
child and family prior to their leaving the center and determine intent for self-harm or if
the response was/was not representative of the child’s actual state.
