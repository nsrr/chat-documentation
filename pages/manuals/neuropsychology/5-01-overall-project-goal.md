## 5.1 Overall Project Goal

Untreated, pediatric obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with a wide range
of adverse health outcomes, which may lead to chronic health sequelae. A major component of
OSAS morbidity relates to short, and possible, long-term NP deficits caused by exposure to
intermittent hypoxemia, arousal, and sleep deprivation, acting independently or synergistically.
Adenotonsillar enlargement is the most commonly recognized risk factor for OSAS in children.
This project examines the hypothesis that Adenotonsillectomy (AT) in children aged 5 to 9 years
will result in measurable improvements in health outcomes measured 6 months following AT.
Children eligible for AT in standard practice will be randomized to expedited (early)
adenotonsillectomy (EAT) versus Watchful Waiting with Supportive Care (WW) with surgical
treatment decisions deferred until after a seven (7) month observation period, with continued
follow-up through twelve (12) months. The cognitive and behavioral tests were chosen to
emphasize measurements sensitive to sleepiness or intermittent hypoxemia, as well as
providing reliable measures of overall cognitive ability, memory, language abilities, psychomotor
skills, behavior, and mood.
