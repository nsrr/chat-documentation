## 5.2.0 Overview of NP Study Design

### 5.2.1 Participants

* Female and male children, ages 5-9.99 years with documented obstructive sleep apnea
syndrome (OSAS)
* 460 children are anticipated to be recruited from ENT and Sleep Clinics at the four
participating clinical sites

### 5.2.2 Examiners
* The NP group agreed that the same room should not be used for the blood draw and the
neuropsychological testing
* The NP group agreed that the same person who does the blood draw should not do the
neuropsychological testing

### 5.2.3 NP-associated exclusion criteria
* Mental retardation (DAS-II General Conceptual Ability Composite = 55)
* Family unable to speak English adequately to understand informed consent and able to
complete the standardized English language assessment forms
* This protocol also will establish written local protocol instructions, consistent with local
IRB, on how/who will determine whether the child meets exclusion criteria based on the
protocol statement (Protocol Section 5.3 Exclusion Criteria):
”Psychiatric or behavioral disorders requiring initiation of new medication, therapy, or
other specific treatment during the 12 month trial period.”
