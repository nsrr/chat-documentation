## 5.6.4 Procedures for CDI and Peds QL

* The Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) will only be administered to children 7 years
of age or older, consistent with the standardization procedures. If a child’s cognitive
ability makes reading this form difficult, the psychometrician will read the form to the
child. If assistance is given, it should be noted on the form (CDI).
* The Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) has parallel child-self-report and parent proxy
report forms. Separate reports are used because child self-reports are based on
perceptions of internal states, whereas parent reports reflect the child’s observable
behaviors. It is self-administered for parent and for children age > 8 yrs. It is interviewer
administered if the child is 5 to 7 years of age. If assistance is given, it should be noted
on the response form (CHQL) by either the NP examiner or coordinator providing the
forms.
