## 1.4 Placement of AMBP Cuff

The cuff should be placed on the child’s non-dominant arm and in the correct position.
The arrow should point to mid point of anticubital fossa (or “inside elbow”). Measure 1” (2
finger breaths) above the crease in the antecubital fossa of the child’s non-dominant arm
(suggest marking the child’s arm – this may be helpful to the parent if the cuff is released
during the 24 hour period and has to be replaced). Make sure the cuff is snug enough
that it will not slide but not too tight (if no more that 2 finger breaths can slide under the
cuff than it is not too tight or too loose).

### 1.4.1 Participant

The participating child will be asked to wear the blood pressure monitor for a period of
24 hours beginning on the day of the baseline visit (after all other testing has been
performed and completed, and if the subsequent day is not a school day) and again at
the primary end point visit, Month 7. (If the subsequent day is a school day, the
participant will be asked to use the ABPM on the first non-school day as described
above. The purpose and proper use of the monitor/equipment must be clearly explained
and demonstrated to the parent/legal guardian and to the participant.

### 1.4.2 Talking Points
The coordinator may want to inform the child that h/she may feel:

> “Arm will get a hug every 30 minutes (or half hour)”

> “Wearing the cuff can be fun; you can play “Mr. Freeze” (no sports, etc.)

> “If you feel the cuff squeezing your arm, do not remove – just stand still like a
statue”

### 1.4.3 Parent or Legal Guardian

The coordinator will instruct the child/parent/legal guardian on the proper use of the
blood pressure device and recording diary; stressing the importance of recording sleep
and awake times. An instruction sheet will be provided as a quick reference guide (refer
to the supplemental Diary Instructions Form attached. The parent/legal guardian will be
instructed to complete the diary and return it with the monitor in the pre-paid shipping
container within 2 days.

### 1.4.4 Research Coordinator
The research coordinator will be responsible for programming and calibrating (or
initializing) the AMBP, instructing the parent and child on its proper use, distribution the
diary and instruction sheet and recording the equipment on the Device Accountability
Log [DEVICE]. Also arrangements must be made for return of the equipment and
completed diary prior to leaving the facility. A prepaid shipping container
within 2 days
