## 1.6 Quality Control of Blood Pressure

Quality control will be achieved by central training and certification of all technicians,
assuring that study personnel follow all protocol elements, including approaches for
measuring the childâ€™s arm and placing the cuff. Use of a calibrated, automated BP
monitoring device will minimize technician variability in identifying Korotkoff sounds.
Although such measurements may not agree completely with measurements made by a
random zero sphygmomanometer, use of a mercury device is no longer permissible; an
automated device minimizes technician variability, optimizing consistency across the
study. To optimize accuracy, at the beginning of the study, and then monthly, the
monitor will be checked by the department of clinical engineering for

* calibration check
* accuracy of the readings and presence of pressure leakage.
