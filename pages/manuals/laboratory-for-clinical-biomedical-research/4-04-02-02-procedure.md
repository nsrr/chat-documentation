## 4.4.2.2 Procedure

For <u>frozen</u> shipment to the LCBR at the University of Vermont:

1. Line Styrofoam mailer(s) with absorbent material (i.e. paper towels).
2. Place approximately 1/2 the dry ice (per mailer) on the bottom of the
mailer.
3. Place another layer of absorbent material (i.e.: paper towels) on top of
the dry ice so it will be between the dry ice and the freezer boxes
containing the samples.
4. Collect the freezer boxes containing samples to be shipped and check
the sample ID numbers against the Processing Forms for that shipment.
5. Place a rubber band around each cardboard freezer box containing samples
before enclosing each box in a Ziploc plastic bag. Then carefully place these
bagged boxes containing samples in the mailer. The rubber band is important
for aiding in the prevention of a cryovial spill; the Ziploc bag and absorbent
material are for compliance with commercial carrier specifications.
6. Another layer of absorbent material is placed on top of the sample freezer
boxes.
7. The remaining dry ice is placed on top of this last layer of absorbent material.
(Samples should not be on dry ice for > 24 hours).
8. The top of the styro is sealed on with tape and then enclosed in the outer
cardboard sleeve.
9. The Processing and Collection Forms for all samples included in that particular
Styrofoam mailers are placed on the top of the styro before the outer sleeve is
securely taped closed.
