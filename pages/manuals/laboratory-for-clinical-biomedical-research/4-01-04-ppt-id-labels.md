## 4.1.4 Participant ID Labels

The LCBR will supply the sites with sheets of sample ID barcode labels to use for labeling
forms, draw tubes, and cryovials. These ID numbers will be different from the participant ID
number and care must be taken to correctly identify the participant ID number on the collection
and processing forms.

The cryovial labels also have a 2-digit extension (01 to 11) that serves as a unique identifier for
each cryovial within a sample ID.

It is essential that blood samples be precisely labeled throughout the collection and processing
stages to ensure that participant samples are not miscoded. To facilitate accurate labeling, it is
suggested that you pre-label sets of collection tubes and cryovials prior to the participant's visit.
Please do not tape over the cryovial labels. Tape may interfere with the scanning of the
cryovials when they arrive at the LCBR.
