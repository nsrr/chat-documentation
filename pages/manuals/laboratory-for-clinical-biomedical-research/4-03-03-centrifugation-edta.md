## 4.3.3 Centrifugation - EDTA

If centrifugation is not immediate, tubes are stored upright on wet ice for up to 30 minutes.
Tubes are centrifuged at 4°C at a minimum of 2,000 x g for 15 minutes or 3,000 x g for 10
minutes (for a total of 30,000 g-minutes). Maximum time elapsed before centrifugation is 30
minutes from time of collection. <u>Please note all start times on the Blood Processing Form.</u> Once
centrifugation is complete, tubes are carefully placed on ice and are ready to aliquot. 0.5mL of
EDTA plasma will be aliquoted into purple-top cryovials # 10 through 19. The remaining packed
cells are carefully poured into tube #20. The packed cell tube # 11 is a white-capped tube that
will be frozen and sent to the LCBR for future DNA extraction.

Once the samples are aliquoted, the EDTA blood collection tube can be discarded in the
biohazard waste (puncture-proof containers). The cryovials and tube #20 should be immediately
frozen at -80°C
