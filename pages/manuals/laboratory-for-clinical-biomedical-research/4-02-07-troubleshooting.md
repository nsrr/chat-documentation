## 4.2.7  Troubleshooting

_**Not all tubes are collected (blood flow ceases, difficult venipuncture, etc.).**_

Always fill collection tubes in the order specified.  Make notations of difficulties on the Phlebotomy form.  If the participant is willing, another attempt should be made to complete the draw collecting only those tubes that were not filled in the first venipuncture.


_**Collection tube does not fill.**_

First, try another tube of the same type.  Partially filled plasma EDTA tubes are not acceptable if less than 1/2 full.  Partial tubes for serum are okay, but will result in a reduced number of aliquotes.  If a tube is not completely filled, clearly note on the Processing Form as this can affect future assays.
