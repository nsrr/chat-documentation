## 4.2.6 Venicpuncture Procedure

_**ALWAYS WEAR HOSPITAL LABORATORY GLOVES AND A LAB COAT**_

* 1. Arrange draw tubes in order of draw on the table top or in the tube rack within easy reach.  Assemble butterfly apparatus and Vacutainer holders, guaze, and alcohol prep prior to tourniquet application.
* 2. Apply tourniquet.
* 3. Examine participant's arms for the best site for venipuncture.  Release tourniquet.
* 4. Cleanse venipuncture site by wiping with alcohol prep pad in a circular motion from center to periphery.  Allow area to dry.
* 5. Reapply tourniquet and start timer.

<u>**NOTE 1**</u>: If possible, it is best to <u>release the tourniquet</u> as soon as possible after flow has been established.  Tightened tourniquet should be on no longer than 2 minutes; if longer, loosen tourniquet, and then reapply if necessary.

* 6. Grasp the participant's arm firmly, using your thumb to draw the skin taut.
This anchors the vein. The thumb should be 1 or 2 inches below venipuncture site.
venipuncture site.
* 7. With the needle bevel upward, enter the vein in a smooth continuous motion.
* 8. Make sure the participant's arm is in a flat or downward position while
maintaining the tube below the site when the needle is in the vein. It may
be helpful to have the participant make a fist with the opposite hand and
place it under the elbow for support.
* 9. Grasp the flange of the Vacutainer holder and gently push the tube forward until
the butt end of the needle punctures the stopper, exposing the full lumen of the
needle.

<u>**NOTE 2</u>: Attention should be paid to <u>minimize turbulence</u> whenever possible.  Small steps, suchs as slanting the needle in the <u>Vacutainer</u> to have the blood run down the side of the tube instead of shooting all the way to the bottom, may result in significant improvement.**

* 10. Note the blood flow into the first collection tube. If blood is flowing freely,
the butterfly needle can be taped to the participant's arm for the duration of
the draw. If the flow rate is very slow, the needle may not be positioned
correctly. Try moving the needle slightly without causing discomfort to the
participant.
* 11. Keep a constant, slight forward pressure (in the direction of the needle) on
the end of the tube. This prevents release of the shutoff valve and stopping
of blood flow. Do not vary pressure nor reintroduce pressure after
completion of the draw.
* 12. Fill each Vacutainer tube as completely as possible; i.e., until the vacuum
is exhausted and blood flow ceases. If a Vacutainer tube fills only partially.
remove the tube and attach another without removing the needle from vein
* 13. When the blood flow ceases, remove the tube from the Vacutainer holder.
The shutoff valve re-covers the point, stopping blood flow until the next
tube is inserted (if necessary). Place the EDTA tube on tube mixer for a
minimum of 30 seconds. (The EDTA tube may also be mixed manually by
gently inverting the tubes for at least 30 seconds.) Do not mix the serum
tube.
* 14. Release tourniquet, if still applied.
* 15. To remove the needle, lightly place clean gauze over venipuncture site. DO
NOT have the patient bend his/her arm as this can cause a hematoma.
Remove the needle quickly and immmediately apply pressure to the site with
a gauze pad. Have the participant hold the gauze pad firmly for one to two
minutes to prevent a hematoma. Discard needle into puncture-proof sharps
container. Record on Phlebotomy form duration tourniquet was applied and
length of venipuncture.
* 16. The EDTA tube is placed on wet ice. The serum tube is held at room
temperature.
* 17. Clean up the venipuncture area (if necessary).  Dispose of needle and
tubing in the appropriate biohazard needle sharps containers. Comple
the Phlebotomy Form
* 18. Bring the filled blood collection tubes to the processing area, keeping th
EDTA tube on ice and the Serum tube at room temperature.
