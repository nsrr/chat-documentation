## 4.3.4 Centrifugation - Serum

Allow the Serum tubes to clot for 40 minutes at room temperature (maximum time before
centrifugation is 90 minutes). These tubes are centrifuged at 4° C at 2,000 x g for 15 minutes or
3,000 x g for 10 minutes for a total of 30,000 g-minutes. After centrifugation is complete, place
on ice.

One mL is aliquoted in one tall 4mL tube (tube #1). This sample will be used for a lipid profile.
The remaining serum is aliquoted into (8) 1.5 mL red-top cryovials # 2 – 9 in 0.5 mL aliquots.
These samples should be immediately frozen at -80°C

The remaining cells in the serum draw tube and the tube itself can be discarded in the
biohazardous waste.
