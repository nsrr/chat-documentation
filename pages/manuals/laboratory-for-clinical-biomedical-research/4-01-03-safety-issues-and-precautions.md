## 4.1.3 Safety Issues and Precautions for Handling Blood Specimens

In accordance with the OSHA regulations on blood borne pathogens, the LCBR recommends
the following laboratory safety protocol for the blood collection at the GCRC:

* Use of non-permeable lab coats, gloves, and face shields when handling any blood in
any situation where splashes, spray, spatter, or droplets of blood may be generated, and
eye, nose, or mouth contamination can be reasonably anticipated.
* Use of aerosol containers in all centrifuges is strongly recommended.
* Follow 'Universal Precautions' when handling any blood products.
* Contaminated needles and sharps shall be immediately placed in a puncture-resistant,
leak proof container. Never recap or break needles.
* Offer the Hepatitis B vaccine to all unvaccinated technicians handling blood, and
document accordingly (vaccination completed or declined) on file at the GCRC.
