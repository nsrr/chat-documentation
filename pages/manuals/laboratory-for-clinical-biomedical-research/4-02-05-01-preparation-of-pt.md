## 4.2.5 Preparation

### 4.2.5.1 Preparation of Participants for Phlebotomy

Informed consent must have been obtained before blood is drawn. *Use “child friendly
approaches”- Child Life guidelines attached.* Provide opportunity to use a topical
anesthetic (see Attachment A).

Blood drawing is standardized for the sitting position. The venipuncture is performed with
a _21 or 25 gauge_ butterfly needle with 12 inches of plastic tubing between the
venipuncture site and the blood collection tubes. The butterfly has a small, thin walled
needle that minimizes trauma to the skin and vein. The use of 12 inches of tubing allows
tubes to be changed without any movement of the needle in the vein. The participant
should be given enough time to feel comfortable both before and after the blood
collection. The participant should spend at least 10 minutes in a supine or seated
position before blood is drawn. In many cases the most memorable part of the
experience for the participant will be the contact with the technicians/nurses who draw
the blood and their general attitude and competence. DO NOT under any circumstances
force the participant to have blood drawn.
