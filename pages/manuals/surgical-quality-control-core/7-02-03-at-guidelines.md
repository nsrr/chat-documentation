## 7.2.3 AT Guidelines

The RC will notify the surgeon when a study patient is scheduled for surgery and ensure the
data collection form is available. To monitor surgical consistency, the surgeon will complete
intra-operative data sheets (Attachment B: OPER) on each study patient at the time of surgery
documenting surgical technique, blood loss, size of tonsils and adenoids pre-operatively,
whether or not tonsils were entirely removed and degree of residual adenoid obstruction postoperatively
as well as any intra or peri-operative complications.

In the operating room patients will be orally intubated and general anesthesia will be
administered.

Tonsil size will be graded as:

* 1 taking up 0-25 % of airway
* 2 taking up 26-50 % of airway
* 3 taking up 51-75 % of airway
* 4 taking up 76-100% of airway

Board-certified otolaryngologists, with or without the participation of resident physicians in
accredited otolaryngology training programs, will then remove the right and left tonsils entirely
using either cold dissection or mono-polar electro cautery and obtain hemostasis.
The soft palate will then be inspected and palpated to assure there is no evidence of a submucus
cleft palate. The palate will be retracted. The naso-pharynx and adenoid tissue will be
inspected and graded as mildly (0-33%), moderately (33-66%) or severely (67-100%)
obstructing the posterior choanae. The obstructing portions of adenoid tissue will be removed
using either cold dissection or monopolar electro cautery and hemostasis will be obtained. The
intra-operative data sheet will then be completed and collected by the unblinded coordinator.
