## 7.4.0 Adverse Events Related to AT

Adverse events resulting from surgery will be documented at each institution with the use of the
intra-operative data sheet for intra and peri-operative events. Information about delayed (>24
hours) surgical complications will be obtained from the family during interim follow-up phone
calls at months 2 and 5 for the EAT arm and at month 10 and12 (clinic visit) for the WWSC arm
and will be supplemented by any information about adverse events obtained by the
otolaryngologist during routine post-operative clinic visits or phone contacts or any other patient
interactions. The participant and his/her guardian will be instructed to notify the project
coordinator of any changes in medical condition, including hospitalization or the need for clinic
visits related to surgery other than those which are part of routine post-operative care.
