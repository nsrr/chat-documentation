## 7.2.4.2 Electronic Transfer of Photos and Corresponding CRF

The corresponding, completed CRF [OPER] will be faxed (or scanned and sent via
email) when the pre and post-procedure photographs are transmitted electronically to
the Surgical Quality Control Core (SQCC). The photos and corresponding CRFs will be
examined regularly by a single otolaryngologist at the Surgical Quality Control Core. All
photos must list the 6 digit participant identification number (PID), 2 digit site number,
date and surgeons initials as listed on the corresponding CRF.

The photos will be compared to the data obtained on the intra-operative data sheet to
ensure that the grading system is being consistently applied by all surgeons and that
adequate tissue removal has been performed. Any noted discrepancies in scoring or
inadequate tissue removal will be discussed with the specific institutionâ€™s lead
otolaryngologist within 10 days of photo receipt. If repeated discrepancies in scoring or
inadequacy of tissue removal by a particular surgeon or institution are observed despite
verbal feedback, a training session will be arranged to review the grading system and
surgical technique.
