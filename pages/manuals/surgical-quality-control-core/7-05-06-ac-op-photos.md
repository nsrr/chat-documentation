## 7.5.6 Quality Control by Operative Photos

10% (up to 46) of all participants who have AT surgery will have intra- operative surgical photos
taken for quality control purposes. The unblinded research coordinator will be responsible for
keeping track of patients who require intro-operative photos by completing the Surgical Digital
Photo Reporting Log (SURLOG), an administrative form used for tracking purposes only.
Specifically, at each clinical site, each tenth consecutive patient will be photographed in the
operating room, pre and post AT. The unblinded coordinator will be responsible for informing the
otolaryngologist that photographs are required with sufficient notice to ensure that all necessary
equipment is available. De-identified photos will be e-mailed to Surgical QA Core within 48
hours with the intra-operative data form. The photos will also be compared to the data obtained
on the intra-operative data sheet to ensure that the grading system for tonsil and adenoid size is
being consistently applied by all surgeons and that adequate tissue removal has been
performed. Any noted discrepancies in scoring or inadequate tissue removal will be discussed
with the specific institutionâ€™s lead otolaryngologists within 10 working days of photo receipt.
