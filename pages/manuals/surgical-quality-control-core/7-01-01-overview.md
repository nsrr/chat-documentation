## 7.1.0  Quality Monitoring of Surgical Intervention 

### 7.1.1 Overview
The University of Michigan Health Center will oversee the Surgical Monitoring Core under the
direction of Dr. Susan Garetz who will also serve as the central coordinator for the surgical
portion of the study. Dr. Witsell will serve as an outside ENT consultant and will advise on
surgical quality control as well. The University of Michigan and Duke University will not be
participating sites for patient recruitment, thus eliminating any possible institutional bias. Dr.
Garetz will be responsible for standardization of surgery and documentation of techniques,
perioperative care, and complications, and will oversee protocol development for the surgical
intervention at central training. Also, on an ongoing basis, she will facilitate communication and
development of consensus among otolaryngologists at all sites. Lead otolaryngologists from
each of the participating institutions will meet annually at the meetings of the American
Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, and at periodic Steering Committee
meetings for ongoing protocol and operations review.
