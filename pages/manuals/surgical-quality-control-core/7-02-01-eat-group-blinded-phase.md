## 7.2.1 Early Adenotonsillectomy (EAT) Group â€“ Blinded Phase

When a study subject is randomized to the EAT arm, the unblinded research coordinator will
work with the treating ENT and their surgical scheduling office to arrange surgery <u>within 1-4
weeks of the baseline visit</u>. Scheduling surgery for study patients within the specified time frame
will be facilitated as needed by the lead otolaryngologist at each clinical site, who will also be
available to address any persistent scheduling issues.
