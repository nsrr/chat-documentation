## 7.5.4 Site Visit

Within 3 months of initiating data collection, each site will undergo a formal site visit by a team
that will include members from the DCC, SCC/PRC, NP Quality Center, and Surgical Quality
Control Center, if applicable. One member from an alternative clinical site also may participate.
DCC will produce a formal site visit report within one week of the visit which will be shared with
the site, Steering Committee and DSMB. Additional site visits will be scheduled if problems are
identified in the initial visit, or if subsequent performance problems are identified at the site.
