### 7.2.4.3 Training Video for Surgical Procedures

A training video will be available for all participating surgeons outlining the procedures
for surgical documentation and quality assurance including documentary photographs.
All participating surgeons at each clinical site will provide documentation that they have
viewed the video prior to participation in the study. The lead otolaryngologist and
research coordinator will work together to facilitate viewing of the video by the surgeons
participating in the CHAT study. The attestation form (Attachment G: [VIDEO]) must be
signed and kept on file in the regulatory binder. A copy of the signed form must also be
faxed to the project manager at the Data Coordinating Center.
