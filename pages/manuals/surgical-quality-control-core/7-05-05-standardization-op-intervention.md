## 7.5.5 Standardization of Operative Intervention

The Intra-operative data sheet filled out on each patient at time of surgery and the
corresponding case report form will be completed and entered into the DMS within 48 hours.
These data sheets will document the surgical technique, blood loss, size of tonsils and adenoids
pre-operatively, whether or not tonsils were entirely removed, and the degree of residual
adenoid obstruction post-operatively. Intra-operative complications will also be captured. It is the
responsibility of the unblinded coordinator to make sure these forms are completed and
collected on each participant, including those in the WWSC arm who undergo surgery. DCC will
run reports on a biannual basis for review by the Director of the SQCC.
