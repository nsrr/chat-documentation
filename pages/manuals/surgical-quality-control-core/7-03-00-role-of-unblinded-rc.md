## 7.3.0 Role of Unblinded Research Coordinator

In addition to tracking all surgical cases and notifying the surgeon when intra-operative photos
will be required (refer to section 2.4) the unblinded coordinator is responsible for providing the
data collection forms/CRFs to the ENT surgeons for completion and to collect/obtain the
information for entry into the DMS. The unblinded coordinator along with the site PI (when
applicable) must act as a liaison between [their] research department and the ENT clinic to
assure accurate and timely conduct of the following protocol specific procedures:

* Scheduling/obtaining initial ENT evaluation
* Providing data collection forms/CRFs to the ENT surgeon for completion
* Collecting forms and checking for completeness
* Entering data into the DMS
* Assuring AT is scheduled within the 4 week time period
* Tracking all surgical patients
* Informing Surgeons of PSG results as needed
* Contacting the surgeon when intra-operative photos are required
* Managing equipment for surgical photos (refer to section 2.4)
* Completing the follow up phone and clinical post operative assessments
* Scheduling the WWSC Month 8 re-evaluation at the time of randomization

_Note:_ Although the process may vary from site-to-site, attaching the data collection forms to the
subjectâ€™s chart prior to the scheduled appointment time (initial evaluation, surgery and reevaluation
for the WWSC arm) may provide an efficient mechanism for collection.
