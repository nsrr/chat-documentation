## 7.4.2 Tracking Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events for AT

All adverse events and SAEs will be documented and tracked using a composite data sheet
(refer to Master Manual of Procedures). Specific information about adverse events relating to
surgery will be supplemented by review of medical charts by the site project coordinator and PI
as appropriate. Although this will require unblinding of the randomization status of these
subjects, we anticipate these events will be unusual enough that the integrity of the study data
will not be compromised.
