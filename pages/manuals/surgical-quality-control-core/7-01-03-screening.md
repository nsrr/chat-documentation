## 7.1.3 Screening

Potentially eligible candidates will be evaluated by an otolaryngologist prior to entry the study.

### 7.1.3.1 Pre-Operative ENT Evaluation (Screening)

To determine eligibility for CHAT participation, all potentially eligible subjects will be
evaluated by an otolaryngologist to confirm surgical candidacy and tonsillar size (refer to
section 2.3 for grading scale). Children determined to be in need of immediate surgical
treatment by the ENT surgeon will not be enrolled.

_Note:_ A previous ENT evaluation may be used to determine surgical eligibility if it was
conducted within the prior 90 days.

### 7.1.3.2 ENT Evaluation and Preoperative Questionnaire (PREOP)

The screening evaluation will include assessment and documentation of the following:

* Tonsillar Size
* Contraindications for surgery
* Surgical candidacy

For tracking purposes all data collection forms must be initialed by the otolaryngologist
performing the assessment (refer to section 4 for a list of ENT-related forms and
Appendix A for PREOP form completion guidelines). If a previous ENT evaluation is
being utilized, the unblinded research coordinator must extract the information required
from the source document (ENT medical record); complete the PREOP form, listing the
otolaryngologist’s initials, counter initial, and date. The otolaryngologist’s initials will get
entered into the data management system (DMS) for tracking purposes.
