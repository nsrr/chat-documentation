## 7.3.1.2 Intra-Operative Form

The Intra-operative data sheet/CRF filled out on each patient at time of surgery will be
completed and entered into the DMS within 48 hours. These data sheets will document
the surgical technique, size of tonsils and adenoids pre-operatively, whether or not
tonsils were entirely removed, blood loss and the degree of residual adenoid obstruction
post-operatively. Intra- or peri-operative complications will also be captured. Tonsillar
and adenoid size scales are described in section 7.2.3.
