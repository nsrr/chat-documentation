## 7.5.7 Surgical Monitoring

Complications resulting from surgery beyond the immediate post-operative period will be
documented at each institution by a phone call from the project coordinator at months 2 and 5
for the EAT arm and at 10 months and at the 12 month clinical visits for the WWSC arm if
surgery was performed. All adverse events which exceed threshold criteria (as defined
Appendix C of the protocol and in the master Manual of Procedures), SAEs and those that meet
the definition of an unanticipated problem that requires reporting (refer to Appendix C of the
protocol) will be captured in the DMS. These data will be tabulated and reports will be generated
by the DCC who will disseminate the information to the Director of the SQCC on a biannual
basis, unless an SAE has been identified.

If a surgical complication is noted that exceeds expectation of usual care, or any site or surgeon
is noted to experience significant deviations from reported national rates (as defined by either
the SQCC or the DSMB), Dr. Garetz, Director of SQCC, will initiate an investigation and prepare
a report for the DCC, DSMB and Steering Committee as appropriate. Dr. Garetz will present
follow-up recommendations to the Steering Committee and actions may include ongoing
monitoring, retraining, excluding the participation of specific surgeons, or excluding specific
sites. The DSMB will be notified prior to implementation of the recommended follow up plan.
