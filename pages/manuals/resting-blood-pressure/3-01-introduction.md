## 3.1 Introduction

Resting blood pressure will be collected in the clinic on 3 occasions; at the Baseline
Visit, Month 7 (primary endpoint) and Month 12 (final). All CHAT personnel performing
resting blood pressure measurements on CHAT participants must be certified in
performing resting blood pressure according to the guidelines listed in this manual.

All personnel performing this procedure must complete the training and certification
Module (Attachment) and also listed on the siteâ€™s CHAT Responsibility Log.

### 3.1.1 Guidelines for Obtaining Accurate Resting Blood Pressure in Children

Blood pressure (BP) readings of high quality are fundamental to understanding the role
of exposures such as sleep apnea on predisposition to hypertension. Yet many factors,
including influences of the subject, the observer, the equipment, and the circumstances
of the measurement, work against the attainment of this basic objective. Good results
cannot be taken for granted, then, and special attention must be focused on BP
measurement procedures.

### 3.1.2 Equipment Needed

1. Tape Measure (cm)
2. Various size cuffs: large adult, adult, child, infant
3. Sphygmomanometer (mercury preferred, if not aneroid that has been
calibrated against a mercury device within prior 6 months).
4. Stethoscope and Double Headed Stethoscope for BP certification and
calibration of equipment.
