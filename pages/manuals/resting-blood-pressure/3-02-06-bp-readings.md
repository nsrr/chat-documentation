## 3.2.6 Blood Pressure Readings

Next, the observer should proceed to carry out the first BP reading. <u>The systolic value
(1st phase Korotkoff) can be identified as the pressure level where the first of 2 or more
sounds are heard in the appropriate rhythm. The diastolic value (5th phase Korotkoff) can
be identified as the pressure level where the last of these rhythmic sounds is heard.</u>

**NOTE:** <u>A single sound heard in isolation</u> (i.e., _not in rhythmic sequence_) before the first
of the rhythmic sounds (systolic) or following the last of the rhythmic sounds (diastolic)
does not meet criteria for the systolic or diastolic endpoints. _If the sounds are heard all
the way to 0 mm Hg, record the 4th phase DBP as follows_:

> The measurement should be recorded as Korotkoff 1 - Korotkoff 4 - Korotoff 5
> (e.g., 122/60/0) on the source document for future reference. **When this occurs you
> must record the resting blood pressure on the BP CRF as: SBP is defined as
> Kortokoff 1 (K1) and DBP as Korotoff 5 (K5).**

The American Heart Association (1980) defines the K-sounds as follows: (American
Heart Association. _Recommendation for Human Blood Pressure Determination by
Sphygmomanometer._ Dallas, American Heart Association, 1980).

* Phase I: The point marked by the first appearance of faint, clear tapping sounds
that gradually increase in intensity.
* Phase IV: The point marked by the distinct, abrupt muffling of sound so that a soft,
blowing quality is heard.
* Phase V: The point at which the sound disappears.
