## 5.10.3 Outlier Checks

### Study-by-study outlier review

After each study is scored and an initial report is generated, the scorer will use a computer program to identify extreme outliers. These entries will be reviewed and the results of this review will be noted on a PSG scoring form. New reports will be generated if any editing of the record is required.

### Batch outlier review

The reports will be subjected to a secondary review for outliers when being read into the main dataset. Any records with outliers so identified will be checked to ascertain that this record was previously identified as containing an outlier, with adequate documentation of the problem. If no documentation is found on the QS form, the study will be returned to the scorer for verification or correction as needed.
