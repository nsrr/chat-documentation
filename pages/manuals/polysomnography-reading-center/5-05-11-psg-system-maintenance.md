## 5.5.11 PSG System Maintenance


Sites must establish and maintain an equipment log for acquisition units and auxiliary devices which will include the following:

- Vendor name and model and serial number of PSG instrument and all external devices used to collect the
PSG.
- Dates of safety checks as required by the host hospital laboratory.
- Initial verification and synchronization of acquisition instrument and external devices to internal clock time settings (if necessary) and electrical calibration settings (i.e.: voltage of external devices must be calibrated to the PSG system).
- Maintenance and repair log for each instrument including date and description of any software installation or upgrades.
- The same auxiliary devices must be assigned to the specific PSG instrument for each submitted recording. If a particular device is moved or swapped for any reason (i.e.: use in another bedroom, troubleshooting exercises, introduction of loaner equipment during repairs, etc.) between submissions the device must be re-calibrated to the acquisition instrument prior to PSG. PRC must be notified of any changes with respect to the acquisition instrument and its assigned devices including the date of and reason for the change and serial number of the new device.
