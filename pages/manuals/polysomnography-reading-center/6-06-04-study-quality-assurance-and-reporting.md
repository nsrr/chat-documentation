## 6.6.4 Study Quality Assurance and Reporting

After full scoring, a QS Report indicating PSG eligibility, Urgent Referral, and study quality assessment will be available on the SRC website. Site Coordinators will need to register at the CHAT website to access the Quality Reports. If the participant is ineligible due to an Urgent Referral, an abbreviated Sleep Report (i.e., including OAI, AHI, saturation values, heart rate, sleep stage distributions and arousal index) will be transmitted to the coordinator (or other site designee) via the alert e-mail from the PRC. The abbreviated Sleep Report will also be posted on the SRC website for all ineligible studies. Before reports are generated, report data from each study is checked for outlying values and data integrity. These outlier and data integrity checks are repeated when PSG data from multiple participants are combined into a single dataset. This full PSG dataset will be cumulatively compiled and electronically transmitted to the DCC on a regular basis.
