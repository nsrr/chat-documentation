## 5.6.10 PSG Quality Grades (QS Form)

The quality of each signal and overall study quality will be assessed at the time of scoring of the record. The Scorer will code each channel of information according to the duration of: i) scorable signals; ii) duration of artifact free signals during sleep, and iii) an overall QA grade to each study. The total duration of the study (from the edited lights off to the lights on) and the total duration of sleep will also be indicated. Scoring notes regarding staging, event identification, outliers, and specific physiologic signal issues are also recorded on the QS form. Eligible/Ineligible PSG status will also be included in the QS form. Appendix A contains a sample Receipt/QS Form.

All data contained in the QS form (quality grades and scoring notes) will be entered in the QS table database that contains only passed scored studies.
