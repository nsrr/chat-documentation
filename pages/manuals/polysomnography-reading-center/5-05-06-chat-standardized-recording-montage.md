## 5.5.6 CHAT Standardized Recording Montage

- The use of this recording montage requires the use of CHAT standardized sensors and placement.
- The signals to collect do not have to be in any specific order but all must be present on recording.
- All EOG, EEG signals must be collected to reference. When possible, Chin EMG, Leg EMG and ECG signals will be collected to reference.
- Sampling rates for signal collection are minimum rates and may be exceeded depending on rates offered by the acquisition system.  Sampling rates should be the same among like channels (i.e.: EEG, EMG, Respiratory signals).
- Signals will be collected unfiltered (at hardware settings).  This may vary according to the acquisition system.
- Peak-to-Peak Range of Amplifier may not be adjustable, depending on acquisition system but must allow for adequate display of the signal.
- 60 Hz filter may be on for collection
- Established names for respiratory signals may be preserved if the laboratory provides clear indication of its meaning
