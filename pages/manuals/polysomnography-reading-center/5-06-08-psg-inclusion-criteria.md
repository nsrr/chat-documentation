## 5.6.8 PSG Inclusion Criteria

The centrally scored Quality report will be available on the PRC website for both the clinical site and the DCC where it will be imported into a study eligibility file. Based on the PSG findings, ENT evaluation, and initial eligibility criteria, final eligibility will be determined and randomization will occur. Families will be contacted by the un-blinded scheduling coordinator, consent will be re-affirmed, and the baseline visit will be scheduled within two weeks (14 days) of PSG or confirmation of PSG eligibility. PSG inclusion criteria that must be
met are as follows:

Diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea defined as: Obstructive Apnea Index (OAI) > 1 or Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) > 2, confirmed on nocturnal, laboratory-based PSG and Parental report of habitual snoring (on average occurring >3 nights per week).
