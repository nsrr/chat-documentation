## 5.5.4 PSG Montage

Polysomnography will reflect new (2007) AASM standards as closely as acquisition instrument will allow. PSG will be collected using 17 EEG electrodes with face and scalp placements: E1, E2, F3, F4, C3, C4, T3, T4, O1, O2, M1, M2, L Chin, R Chin, C Chin, patient ground and common reference. These will afford a minimum of 11 channels to measure sleep stages: Electro-oculography (E1, E2), submental electromyography (EMG) (L Chin/C Chin), F3/M2, F4/M1, C3/M2, C4/M1, T3/M2, T4/M1 O1/M2, O2/M1, In addition, the following cardio-respiratory and other ancillary data are continuously recorded: Chest and abdominal wall motion by inductive plethysmography with a sum signal (ProTech Z-rip System); EtCO2 by waveform and numeric display (Novametrix capnograph); Oronasal airflow by polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) sensor (Dymedix™ or comparable technology); Nasal airflow by nasal pressure cannula (Protech™ or Salter cannula); Pulse oximetry (SpO2) numeric and plethysmograph waveform or other signal quality indicator (Nonin model 3012
or comparable ); Heart rate by ECG with a standard 3-lead precordial placement; Right and left leg movements (by EMG); Position sensor (mercury gauge). Snore microphone may be included at discretion of the site but will not be mandatory. PSG collected in clinical labs prior to enrollment may omit T3, T4 scalp electrodes and may use an alternate capnograph (BCI).
