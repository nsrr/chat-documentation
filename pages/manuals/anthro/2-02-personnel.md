## 2.2 Personnel

Trained and certified CHAT personnel, certified for performance of these measurements are the
only individuals who will perform them. Each site will designate at least two such individuals,
who may include:

1. research nurses
2. research assistants

Each measurement will require two observers: a measurer and a recorder. The role of the
measurer is to apply the tape, take the measurements, etc. S/he reads the measurements. The
recorder will assist in adjusting tapes, verbally repeats the measurement the measurer states,
and records it on the Anthropometry form.

_Note:_ Two observers are ideal, but not always feasible. An alternate suggestion is using a
mirror to perform measurements so chat-trained tech can see where measuring tape is.

**If a recorder is available:** The recorder will assist in adjusting tapes, verbally repeats the measurement the measurer
states, and records it on the Anthropometry form.
