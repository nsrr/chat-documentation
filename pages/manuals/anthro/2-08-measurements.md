## 2.8 Measurements

### 2.8.1 Height
Standing Height is measured to the nearest mm with the subject in stocking feet, using a
wall mounted Holtain Limited stadiometer. The subject should be positioned with so that
their heels, buttocks, back and head are touching the backboard of the stadiometer. For
some obese subjects, and subjects with scoliosis, this may not be possible. In these
cases, the goal is to position the subject so that the spine is as erect as possible. The
head should be positioned with the Frankfurt plane parallel to the floor, i.e., the top of the
external auditory meatus (ear canal) should be level with the inferior margin of the bony
orbit (cheek bone). Once positioned, the participant is asked to take a deep breath in,
and look straight forward. The head piece of the stadiometer or the sliding part of the
measuring rod is gently lowered to the crown of the head, so that the hair is pressed flat.
For children with corn rows, use a sliding caliper to measure the height of the plaits and
adjust the measurement by subtracting this distance from the overall height.

### 2.8.2 Weight
Weight is measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital Healthometer digital scale in
stocking feet and with no blue jeans. Procedure: Assure that the scale is set to record in
kg. The scale should be set to zero before the subject is weighed. Subjects should be
instructed to stand on the center of the scale. Record the value on the Anthropometry
Form (CRFS).

### 2.8.3 Hip Circumference
The subject should be instructed to stand erect with arms at the sides and feet together
(for obese subjects, they should place their feet as close together as is comfortably
possible). The measurer squats at the right side of the subject so that the level of
maximum extension of the buttocks can be seen. An inelastic tape is placed around the
buttocks in a horizontal plane at this level without compressing the skin. The tape should
be parallel to the floor. The assistant (recorder) is needed to help position the tape on
the opposite side of the subjectâ€™s body and assure that the tape is parallel to the floor.
The zero end of the tape should be below the measurement value. The tape is in contact
with the skin but does not indent the soft tissue. The measurement is done to the
nearest 0.1 cm. Take measurement three times and record each.

### 2.8.4 Waist Circumference
Waist measurement should be obtained on direct skin and not over clothing.
The subject stands erect with the abdomen relaxed, the arms at the sides and feet
together. The measurer stands behind the subject and palpates the hip area for the right
iliac crest, and draws a line just above the crest using washable marker. A second mark
is made in the mid-axillary line. The measurer places a tape around this mark, horizontal
to the floor. The subject is asked to turn slowly, holding the tape in position so that the
tape wraps around. This assures that the tape is parallel and that the tape is snug but
does not compress the skin. The measurement should be taken at the end of a normal
expiration, to the nearest 0. 1 cm. Measurements are made three times and recorded.

### 2.8.5 Neck size
Neck size is determined with a non-stretchable cloth measuring tape to the nearest
0.1 cm while the subject is seated with the head in the Frankfort horizontal plane,
measuring at the point below the thyroid prominence, keeping the tape perpendicular to
the horizontal axis of the neck. Take measurement three times, recording each
