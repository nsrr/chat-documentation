## 2.4 Quality Assurance
There are many possible sources of error in making anthropometric measurements. These
include use of uncalibrated equipment, improper positioning of the subject, incorrect or variable
placement of recording devices, and transcription errors. To attempt the highest quality readings
for CHAT, the following approaches will be used:

* Central training and certification of staff;
* Use of a 2-member team; a “measurer” and a “recorder”;
* Use of duplicate readings (x 3)
* Instrument calibration procedures
* Ongoing observation of technique
* DCC monitoring of between and within subject variability, digit preference, etc.
