## 5.5 Polysomnography (PSG)




All children will undergo standardized PSG at baseline and at a 7-month follow-up exam.  All follow-up PSGs will be performed strictly for research purposes. A proportion of baseline PSGs may have already been performed as part of routine clinical care prior to study recruitment.  To assure standardization:

- Many children recruited (i.e. from ENT clinics) will not have been scheduled to undergo a PSG for clinical care. Children who meet the non-PSG criteria for recruitment, but who had not had a PSG, will be required to undergo a research PSG to confirm study eligibility and to collect research quality data to characterize baseline OSA severity.
- Most children recruited from sleep labs/clinics will have undergone baseline PSGs at the participating clinic sites, following techniques that assure standardized data collection (i.e., all sites will modify their routine procedures to use a standardized PSG montage, comparable sensors, minimal sampling rates, and filter use.) These studies will be re-scored centrally to confirm eligibility status. If a clinical PSG has been performed more than one month prior to recruitment or has not been performed using the research sensors and montage, a research PSG will be performed.
