## 5.5.1 PSG Standardized Collection Procedures

To the fullest extent of the PSG instrument, each clinical site will use a standardized approach established at training. Existing laboratory equipment will be used, supplemented by interface to a Nonin model 3012 or other comparable on-board oximeter and a Novametrix Capnogard model 1265 ETCO2 Monitor. A capnograph by other manufacturers (i.e.: BCI) will be permitted for the initial eligibility PSG. Data will be standardized by requiring the use of the same montage, comparable sensors and sampling rates and filters across sites. Children will be monitored by a certified sleep technician trained in pediatric PSG who will also be supervised by a lead technician who was certified at central training or another designee approved by the PRC CP. All PSG data will be edited, scored and summarized at the Case Sleep and Epidemiology Research Center (Case Western University) using well-developed quality assurance approaches.
