## 5.5.2 Scheduling the PSG


One or two days prior to each scheduled PSG (and morning visit), families will be contacted to remind them of the visit and to ensure that intervening medical illnesses has not occurred, requiring visits to be rescheduled. These include: a febrile illness in the previous one week, an upper respiratory illness resulting in increased coughing, nasal problems acutely interfering with sleep. Participants will report to the sleep laboratory
between 7:00-7:30 P.M. Lights out will be no later than 9:00 P.M. and technician awakening at 6:00 A.M. If in REM period at 6:00, waking will be deferred until the REM period has ended. Children are encouraged to maintain their usual daily routine. Neither sedation nor sleep deprivation is used to induce sleep. Children will be accompanied by at least one guardian during the night. Friday and Saturday evening slots will be made available to families to facilitate recruitment by accommodating the child’s school and the accompanying parents’ work schedules.
