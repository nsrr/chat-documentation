## 5.6.3 Study Receipt and Processing

All data placed on the PRC FTP server by sites is backed up daily and then moved to an Incoming Processing folder. Receipt date will be recorded as the day after being placed on the FTP site. The PSG study will be converted to a proprietary format compatible with scoring software. The study will be reviewed by the Chief Polysomnologist (CP) to assess criteria for minimal technical acceptability and Urgent Referral status. The CP will note any signal quality issues and record recommendations for sensor replacements or adjustment. These quality notes will be sent to the designated PSG staff and also be available on the PRC website. CP will also notify the site if a study has failed, or if other technical problems occurred due to faulty technique or equipment not identified by the site. If Urgent Referral Criteria are met, the study is reviewed by the PRC Director and sent to the un-blinded site coordinator via e-mail. The site coordinator is expected to acknowledge receipt of the alert from the PRC and notify the appropriate physicians, site personnel and/or family. Site coordinator will provide PRC with alternate staff to be notified whenever unavailable to process Urgent Referrals.
