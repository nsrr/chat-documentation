## 5.6.12 Archival of Data

After QS data has been entered and quality reports are posted to the PRC website, the complete study folder containing the raw data file, scored files, sleep study report, and the SAS report is placed in a site directory which is backed-up on a daily basis.

The summary scored SAS data are output as individual .txt files. After outlier checks, studies are imported on a monthly basis into a SAS file. This file is sent periodically to the DCC for merging with the main dataset.
