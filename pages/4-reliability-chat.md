## 4. CHAT Reliability ICCs

Statistics run on February 10, 2011.


10 PSG studies were re-scored by two scorers (916 and 931) to assess inter-scorer reliability.  Each scorer had originally scored 5 of the studies, allowing for intra-scorer reliability assessments.

Variables of interest include % of time in sleep stages, arousal index, and AHI.
